**WELCOME**
===

Thank you for viewing our project! Our team members include Bimal Shrestha, Freddy Huitron, Sara Johnson and Supriya Roberson.
This project is a custom sandwich deli we named **Freddy's Deli**!

This deli can allow the customer to fully customize their sandwich orders. 
Our application takes advantage of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. We created multiple classes, enums and interfaces to get this completed.
Using these methods as well as a [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/java/example) design pattern helped keep this project organized. 

As new junior developers we also included practices learned in our bootcamp such as arrays, list, streams, file writer etc. As you look through our code, you can see this present. 

Getting started was a little difficult for our team as we had to think outside of the box. We created pseudo code and attempted to create UML diagrams to organize better. Doing so, we were able to successfully delegate what needed to be done by each person.

Our team had to fulfill a few mandatory requirements. Please see below: 

- Various Sandwich Sizes (4", 8", 12")
- Multiple Bread Types
- Regular Toppings
- Premium Toppings
- Adding Extra Toppings Functionality
- Print Receipt (yyyyMMdd-hhmmss.txt format)
- Include Sides, Chips, & Drinks


As a team, we decided that a specific class would handle the user interaction when ran. These screens include:

- Home Screen
- Order Screen
- Add Sandwich
- Add Drink
- Add Chips
- Check Out

Breaking down the project further, you will see the builder classes that aid the Sandwich, Drink  and Deli classes. (_There are a few more that aren't listed_) 
In these classes, you can see that we called our enums to help with the calculations needed for the ordering process. 

We also decided to take on the challenge to include signature sandwiches that can be customized as well.
This includes a BLT and Philly Cheese Steak.

Again, we appreciate you taking the time to view our project!

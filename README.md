# Welcome to Freddy's Deli ðŸ¥ª

Thank you for exploring our custom sandwich deli project! Meet our talented team members: Bimal Shrestha, Freddy Huitron, Sara Johnson, and Supriya Roberson.

### Project Overview

Freddy's Deli is an innovative sandwich ordering application that empowers customers to personalize their sandwich experiences. Leveraging Object-Oriented Analysis and Design principles, we've implemented a robust system with multiple classes, enums, and interfaces, ensuring a seamless and organized project structure. The use of the [Builder design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/java/example) has greatly contributed to maintaining code clarity.

### Technologies and Practices

As junior developers, we've incorporated fundamental practices learned during our bootcamp, such as working with arrays, lists, streams, and file writers. These elements are evident throughout our codebase, reflecting our commitment to applying practical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

### Getting Started

Starting this project presented challenges that required us to think creatively. We employed pseudocode and UML diagrams to streamline our thought process and successfully distributed tasks among team members. Our mandatory requirements included:

- Various Sandwich Sizes (4", 8", 12")
- Multiple Bread Types
- Regular and Premium Toppings
- Additional Toppings Functionality
- Receipt Generation (yyyyMMdd-hhmmss.txt format)
- Inclusion of Sides, Chips, & Drinks

### User Interaction Screens

To enhance user experience, we designed specific screens:

- Home Screen
- Order Screen
- Add Sandwich
- Add Drink
- Add Chips
- Check Out

### Project Structure

Diving deeper into the project, you'll find builder classes supporting Sandwich, Drink, and Deli functionality (and a few more not explicitly listed). We've utilized enums within these classes to facilitate calculations during the ordering process.

### Signature Sandwiches

As a delightful challenge, we incorporated signature sandwiches like BLT and Philly Cheese Steak, allowing customers to customize them to their liking.
